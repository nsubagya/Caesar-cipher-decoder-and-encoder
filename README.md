# Title: Caesar Cipher Encoder and Decoder in Python

Description:
This project is a Python implementation of a Caesar cipher encoder and decoder. The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. This program allows users to encode and decode messages using the Caesar cipher.

The motivation behind this project stems from a desire to gain practical experience with encryption techniques learned during my studies. I first encountered the Caesar cipher during my Introduction to Cybersecurity course at Harvard University. Additionally, I explored advanced modern algebra, including cryptography, as part of my master's degree program. In 2018, I utilized the SAGE mathematical software system to delve into the cryptographic aspects of modern algebra.

By implementing the Caesar cipher encoder and decoder in Python, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of encryption concepts while also honing my programming skills. This project serves as both a learning tool and a practical application of cryptographic principles. Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to gain insight into the workings of the Caesar cipher and encryption techniques in general.

Features:

*Encode plaintext messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm
*Decode Caesar cipher-encrypted messages to reveal the original plaintext
*Simple and intuitive user interface
*Educational resource for learning about encryption and cryptography
*Easy-to-understand Python code structure and implementation
*Automated to provide the most suitable descriptions and the corresponding decryption key
